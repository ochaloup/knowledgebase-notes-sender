= TODO points

* [line-through]#correct the test for `ConverterAsciidoc`#
* write the processing for output `cz.chalda.knowledgebase.output`
** output should be just to a string, to a file (it's only saving result of the conversion somewhere else),
    and sending via email
* asciidoc processing has to manage correctly images, there is need to have a way to either link
  the images or put the result as a binary to the result html
** maybe the images should be post-processed after the html is generated by asciidoc converter

== TO-CONSIDER

* having a HTTP server which serves the results somehow
** probably Vertex could be used here
* having the configuration of processing steps to be configured via config file
  not only by command line arguments
